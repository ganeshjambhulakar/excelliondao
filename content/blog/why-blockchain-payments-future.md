## The Case for Blockchain Payments

The global payments industry processes over $2 quadrillion annually. Yet, the underlying infrastructure—credit cards, wire transfers, and clearinghouses—was designed decades ago. Blockchain technology offers a fundamental reimagining of how money moves.

### Problems with Traditional Payments

#### High Fees
Credit card processors charge 2-3% per transaction. For a business doing $1M in annual revenue, that's $20,000-30,000 lost to fees.

#### Slow Settlement
Credit card settlements take 2-3 business days. International wire transfers can take up to a week.

#### Chargebacks
Merchants face significant risk from fraudulent chargebacks, often losing both the product and the payment.

#### Limited Global Access
1.7 billion adults worldwide remain unbanked, unable to participate in the digital economy.

## Blockchain Payment Advantages

### Lower Fees
Cryptocurrency transactions typically cost a fraction of credit card fees, especially on Layer 2 networks like Polygon.

| Payment Method | Typical Fee |
|---------------|-------------|
| Credit Card | 2.5-3% |
| Wire Transfer | $25-50 |
| Crypto (L1) | $1-5 |
| Crypto (L2) | $0.01-0.10 |

### Instant Settlement
Blockchain transactions settle in minutes, not days. Funds are available immediately.

### No Chargebacks
Blockchain transactions are final. Once confirmed, they cannot be reversed without the recipient's consent.

### Global Access
Anyone with a smartphone can receive cryptocurrency payments, no bank account required.
